# JRP Vertical Tank – As-Built Drawings

**Client**: JRP Ethiopia  
**Project Type**: As-Built Technical Documentation (3D CAD Model, 2D Layouts, Weld & Calibration Details)

## Description

This project involved the preparation of comprehensive **As-Built drawings** for a **Vertical Storage Tank** designed for **JRP Ethiopia**. The documentation reflects actual construction details including field modifications, weld configurations, and calibration dimensions to support compliance and operational readiness.

### 🔧 Scope of Work
- **3D CAD Model** of the vertical tank structure using **AMETank**
- **2D fabrication and layout drawings**
- **Weld detail representations** (positions, types, sizes)
- **Calibration data** for dimensional verification
- Final **as-built configuration** based on field measurements
