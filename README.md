# Vertical Storage Tank – As-Built Drawings

**Project Type**: As-Built Technical Documentation  
**Scope**: 3D CAD Model, 2D Layouts, Weld & Calibration Details

## 📝 Description

This project involved the preparation of comprehensive **As-Built drawings** for a **Vertical Storage Tank**. The documentation captures the actual field conditions, including construction details, weld configurations, and calibration dimensions, to ensure compliance, quality assurance, and readiness for operational use.

### 🔧 Scope of Work

- **3D CAD Model** of the tank structure using **AMETank**  
- **2D Fabrication and Layout Drawings**  
- **Weld Details** – Positions, types, and sizes  
- **Calibration Data** – Verified dimensional records based on field measurements  
- Final **As-Built Configuration** including any site modifications
